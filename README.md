## Project Description

The primary purpose of the [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset) has  is to predict the purchasing intentions of a visitor to this particular storeâ€™s website. 
After analysing the dataset used Clustering Analysis for understanding user's characteristics (KMeans, Elbow Method)
I used 'Revenue' attribute as class label.
Process for evaluating every classifier shares the same general flow so defined train_test_model function.
In this project, the highest accuracy is aimed with multiple different modeling techniques. 
RandomForestClassifier has the highest accuracy with 90.0%
